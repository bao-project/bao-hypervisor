Introduction
------------

**Bao** (from Mandarin Chinese “bǎohù”, meaning “to protect”) is a lightweight,
open-source embedded hypervisor which aims at providing strong isolation and
real-time guarantees. Bao provides a minimal, from-scratch implementation of
the partitioning hypervisor architecture.

Designed mainly for targeting mixed-criticality systems, Bao strongly focuses
on isolation for fault-containment and real-time behavior. Its implementation
comprises only a minimal, thin-layer of privileged software leveraging ISA
virtualization support to implement the static partitioning hypervisor architecture:
resources are statically partitioned and assigned at VM instantiation time;
memory is statically assigned using 2-stage translation; IO is pass-through only;
virtual interrupts are directly mapped to physical ones; and it implements a 1-1
mapping of virtual to physical CPUs, with no need for a scheduler.

Bao has no external dependencies, such as on privileged VMs running untrustable,
large monolithic general-purpose operating systems (e.g., Linux), and, as such,
encompasses a much smaller TCB.

**NOTE**: This is work in progress! Don't expect things to be complete.
