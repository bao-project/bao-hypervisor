Introduction
------------

**Bao** (from Mandarin Chinese “bǎohù”, meaning “to protect”) is a lightweight,
open-source embedded hypervisor which aims at providing strong isolation and
real-time guarantees. Bao provides a minimal, from-scratch implementation of
the partitioning hypervisor architecture.

Designed mainly for targeting mixed-criticality systems, Bao strongly focuses
on isolation for fault-containment and real-time behavior. Its implementation
comprises only a minimal, thin-layer of privileged software leveraging ISA
virtualization support to implement the static partitioning hypervisor architecture:
resources are statically partitioned and assigned at VM instantiation time;
memory is statically assigned using 2-stage translation; IO is pass-through only;
virtual interrupts are directly mapped to physical ones; and it implements a 1-1
mapping of virtual to physical CPUs, with no need for a scheduler.

Bao has no external dependencies, such as on privileged VMs running untrustable,
large monolithic general-purpose operating systems (e.g., Linux), and, as such,
encompasses a much smaller TCB.

**NOTE**: This is work in progress! Don't expect things to be complete.

Testing Framework Usage
-----------------------

### Prerequisites
- Ensure [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download.html) is installed.
- After cloning the Bao repository, initialize and update the submodules (bao-nix and bao-tests):

```

git submodule update --init --recursive

```

- Install QEMU for your target platform via Nix (first-time runs may take time):

  For **qemu-aarch64-virt**:
```

nix-shell -p 'with import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0c924ec948073580a3c3d438746388d05a38028b.zip") {}; qemu' --run "true"

```

For **qemu-riscv64-virt**:
```

nix-shell -p 'with import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/0c924ec948073580a3c3d438746388d05a38028b.zip") {}; qemu_full' --run "true"

```

### Running Tests
To run tests, invoke the framework using the Makefile target:

```

make tests PLATFORM=<platform> RECIPE=<recipe>

```

Example:

```

make tests PLATFORM=qemu-aarch64-virt RECIPE=single-baremetal/default.nix

```

This will run tests on the specified platform with the given recipe.

### Supported Platforms and Test Setups
The following table summarizes the supported platforms and test setups for the Bao testing framework. It shows which setups support boot tests and which have IRQ tests implemented (e.g., UART and timer interrupts):

| Platform           | Setup            | Boot Tests | IRQ Tests       |
|:------------------:|:----------------:|:----------:|:---------------:|
| qemu-aarch64-virt  | single-baremetal | Yes        | UART, Timer     |
| qemu-aarch64-virt  | single-freertos  | Yes        | UART, Timer     |
| qemu-aarch64-virt  | single-linux     | Yes        | No              |
| qemu-riscv64-virt  | single-baremetal | Yes        | UART, Timer     |
| qemu-riscv64-virt  | single-freertos  | Yes        | UART, Timer     |
| qemu-riscv64-virt  | single-linux     | Yes        | No              |

Example enabling GICv3:

```

make tests PLATFORM=qemu-aarch64-virt RECIPE=single-baremetal/default.nix IRQC=gicv3

```
